In 1913 Luigi Russolo wrote The Art of Noises that included challenges to instrument designers, composers, musicians and audiences.

Of instrument designers he said,
	"We must enlarge and enrich more and more the domain of musical sounds",
and
	"We must replace the limited variety of timbres of orchestral instruments 
	by the infinite variety of timbres of noises obtained through special mechanisms."

This software seeks to provide special mechanisms for the creation of varied sounds.
